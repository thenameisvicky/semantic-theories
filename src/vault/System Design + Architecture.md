2. Domain-Driven Design - Eric Evans

### Real-World System Designs

- Study open-source billing systems like **Kill Bill**, **Opencell**, or **Zuora's concepts**
- Look at **Chargebee API docs** and reverse-engineer the design

**Ask yourself** when building:

- What happens if this grows 10x?
- What happens if it fails halfway?
- Can someone else plug into this?
- What if data changes out of order?

### 📘 Exercise: Redesign WhatsApp

- How would you model chats, users, encryption, delivery, read receipts?
- What happens if the user goes offline?
- How do you avoid message duplication?

Then, move to:

- Payment gateway (like Stripe)
- Billing systems (like you're doing)
- Scheduling systems (e.g., calendars)
- AI job queues for LLM responses, image generation

✅ Write design docs. Create diagrams. Share them for feedback (Reddit, GitHub, Discord, etc.).

## 3. **Build Internal Tools for Yourself**

Design **systems you wish you had**, like:

- Your own billing engine (which you're doing)
- A log aggregator for dev projects
- A system health checker
- An LLM usage tracker with alerts

Even if it's just for personal use, you’re **training your system design muscle**.

## 4. **Study the Right Resources (Not Just YouTube Summaries)**

### 🔥 System Design

- **"Designing Data-Intensive Applications" – Martin Kleppmann**
- **"The Art of Scalability" – Abott & Fisher**
- **System Design Primer** (GitHub): [](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)

### 🔥 AI Systems

- Dive into open-source:
  - LangChain
  - LlamaIndex
  - Hugging Face Transformers
- Study **how orchestration works**, not just how to prompt

📘 Learn to build:

- Vector DB pipelines
- Async LLM job queues
- Multi-agent workflows
- Chat history architecture
- architecture

## 🛠️ 5. **Tinker with Real Tech Stacks**

Knowing theory isn’t enough. Use tools like:

- **Redis / Kafka** → for async queues, pub-sub
- **PostgreSQL / MongoDB** → data modeling for billing, etc.
- **FastAPI / gRPC** → for service APIs
- **Docker / Kubernetes** → infra for deploying systems
- **Elastic / Kibana / Loki** → logging + observability

🔥 Build, break, and rebuild. That’s how you internalize system-level understanding.

## 🧰 6. **Document Principles for Everything You Build**

Just like your billing principles:

- Document why your system exists
- What principles it follows
- What tradeoffs it makes
- What could break

Eventually, you’ll have a **library of design knowledge** that’s portable to any company or startup.

---

## 👥 7. **Work with / Learn from Better Engineers**

You’ll leap forward faster if you:

- Join a company or open-source project with strong tech leadership
- Pair program with senior engineers
- Ask them **why** they did something a certain way

Or, if you’re solo: **reverse engineer open-source system architectures.**

---

## 💡 8. **Invent When You Feel Friction**

Every time you feel like:

- "This doesn’t scale well"
- "This integration feels clunky"
- "This logging sucks"
- "This AI tool is too slow or rigid"

→ **That’s your moment to invent**.

Ask:

- Can I make this a standalone service?
- Can I design a better abstraction?
- Can I expose this as a tool for others?

That’s how you invent original systems.

## 🔄 9. **Balance AI and Non-AI Systems**

Both require **different muscles**:

|AI Systems|Non-AI Systems|
|---|---|
|Prompt engineering|Strong API design|
|Async job queues|Real-time event systems|
|Vector DBs|Relational modeling|
|Orchestration logic|Infra + observability|
|LLM token cost mgmt|Caching, retries, failovers|

✅ **Learn both. Build bridges.** E.g., how can an AI model plug into your billing system to auto-resolve disputes?

---

## 🧭 10. **Become a Principle-Driven Engineer**

In any system you touch, define its:

- **Purpose**
- **Principles**
- **Boundaries**
- **Failure modes**
- **Scaling limits**

Then share those principles with other devs.

→ That’s how you become a **leader**, not just a coder.

## 🚀 TL;DR – Your Path to Inventing System Designs

1. Build full systems from scratch (billing, chat, jobs, AI workflows)
2. Document everything: assumptions, design choices, principles
3. Study architecture from real-world systems
4. Build tools to solve your own pain points
5. Develop abstraction skills: decouple, scale, plug
6. Stay deeply technical but broadly curious
7. Share your thinking in public: blogs, repos, docs
8. Revisit your past systems and improve them
9. Join or create teams where system design is valued
10. Repeat until it becomes instinct
